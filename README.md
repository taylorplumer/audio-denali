### Inspiration
My family and I were traveling to Alaska and specifically Denali National Park. We were deciding between between whether to do the narrated tour bus or the transit bus. Due to the price differential (~40/person instead of ~$140/person), we decided to go with the transit opiton. I went about searching online for any park audio information to play and came across this [park guide] (http://www.alaska.org/guide/denali-park-guide).

Instead of downloading the mp3 files one by one, I chose code up a quick script to pull all of those files and save them in an 'Audio' folder. 


### Alaska- Not The Last Frontier

Currently, the file is specific for the Denali park guide url, but it could be used for other web pages with minimal revisions.
